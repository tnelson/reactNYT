# NYT Puzzle (React)

## For 0320 Students

This repository contains the "real" NYT Puzzle that I run in class. It contains the Firebase connectivity, etc. where the live-code repository does not. I'm providing this in the hope it is helpful, but be aware that there will be some differences between what I did (and needed to do) and your own work. 

When I added the basic Clerk example and Firebase to this repository, I wrote notes as I went. These may be useful.
